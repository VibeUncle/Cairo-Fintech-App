# Cairo Fintech App
 During a certain Bootcamp I was undergoing, I worked on a Fintech project with my team...I was the only Web developer on the team, and this is what we came up with, even though the project is incomplete, but the general idea of what a fintech app should be was delivered!...This project was STRICTLY made for MOBILE PHONES, so the media queries for larger screen sizes were disabled...if youre viewing this project with your PC, on your browser...make sure you activate the mobile screen size using your dev tools.
